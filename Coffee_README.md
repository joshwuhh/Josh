## Coffee ~
Coffee is one of my true loves. I've always wondered about it's place in the global market and this research / case study is going to not only open my mind to it but also provide useful information for othe coffee lovers!
 
##  Info

  
## Datasets Sourced from:
* US Food Imports [https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/u-s-food-imports/]
* Global price of coffee from 1990 to 2024 ARABICA [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCOFFOTMUSDM]
* Global price of coffee from 1990 to 2024 ROBUSTAS [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCOFFROBUSDM]
* Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: Coffee in U.S. City Average [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SEFP01]


<!--- Further Develop --->
## Tech Stack

### Computing Platform
- [Posit Cloud](https://posit.co/products/cloud/cloud/)

### Packages for data pre-processing
- [Tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
- [Dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
- Both which are within the collection, [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
### Data visualisation tool
- [Ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)


<!--- Points to add ---> 

## Oppurtunities for improvement / Notes
- Dataset for US imports needs sheets and data to be seperated and cleaned. This is being done then reuploaded into cloud IDE for analysis.
- Visualizations to be exported / redone within tableau
- adding more data from more other sources
- adding more analyses by region or country level
- extending the analysis not only to coffee, but other drink products within dataset
