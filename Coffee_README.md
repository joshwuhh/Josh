## Coffee ~
Coffee is one of my true loves. I've always wondered about it's place in the global market and this research / case study is going to not only open my mind to it but also provide useful information for othe coffee lovers!
 
##  Info

  
## Datasets Sourced from:
* US Food Imports [https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/u-s-food-imports/]

<!--- Points to add ---> 
## Project Status: In progress 
## Oppurtunities for improvement / Notes
- Dataset for US imports needs sheets and data to be seperated and cleaned. This is being done then reuploaded into cloud IDE for analysis.
- Visualizations to be exported / redone within tableau
