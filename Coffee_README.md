##  Info
A simple analysis of my true love, coffee. Employing my skills in exploratory data analysis with various tools like ggplot2 and tidyr. 

### Questions to ask:
What are the historical trends in retail prices of various types of coffee in the US market? 

How do changes in import volumes or costs influence consumer prices? 

Are there any seasonal or cyclical patterns in coffee prices? 

## Datasets Sourced from:
* US Food Imports [https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/u-s-food-imports/] (Metrics given in kilos) 
* Global price of coffee from 1990 to 2024 ARABICA [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCOFFOTMUSDM]
* Global price of coffee from 1990 to 2024 ROBUSTAS [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCOFFROBUSDM]
* Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: Coffee in U.S. City Average [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SEFP01]


<!--- Further Develop --->
## Tech Stack

### Computing Platform
- [Posit Cloud](https://posit.co/products/cloud/cloud/)

### Packages for data pre-processing
- [Tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
- [Dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
- Both which are core packages within, [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
### Data visualisation tool
- [Ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)


<!--- Points to add ---> 

## Oppurtunities for improvement / Notes
- Dataset for US imports needs sheets and data to be seperated and cleaned. This is being done then reuploaded into cloud IDE for analysis.
- Visualizations to be exported / redone within tableau
- adding more data from more other sources
- adding more analyses by region or country level
- extending the analysis not only to coffee, but other drink products within dataset

##The Process

<!--- 

3/24 spent time setting up my github repository for my project
Compiled a few sources for data and began thinnking of what i could ask of the data sets obtained
as well as how can I bring these together into one file? 

How can I show off data scraping skills? 

Harmonization of data is when you pull multiple sources of data into one set, creating a dataset that is then "harmonized" 

3/26 Began learning more about github portfolio 
designing elements for my readme and linkedin 


3/27
attempted load into big query 
auto detect schema 
encountered error loading, error seemingly with first column in import data
linked github repo to postit cloud
saved individual sheets from data XLS files as CSV files
installed and loaded "readr" package into R studio
changed necessary files to CSV format 
began upload and read the CSV files in R studio .... took about 40 min in total 

3/30
Recapping. 4am suhoor, workout, game, nap, now focus work
