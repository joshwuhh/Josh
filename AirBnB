Downloaded Dataset from Kaggle for Seattle AirBNB rental history. 
Comprised of three seperate CSV files for Dates of rental, Addresses, and reviews. 
These were all combined into one XLS file and loaded into Tableau
Listings is main table, inner joined with other two by ID = LISTING ID  because everything in listing will be in calendar/reviews by ID  
Began by comapring zip to price, changed measure of price to see AVG rather than SUM 
** Ordered this data and see that highest price zipcode is 98134 **



** Understanding The Data ** 
Most data is not needed for the visualizations such as Name of listing , Comments etc
There are approx. 3.6k locations in Listings 
  1 Million entries in Calendar


Listings - The information on the actual rental (Bedrooms, Location, Fees, Etc) 
Reviews - Information on reviews for each property. 
     THREE ID's ARE PRESENT. 
      Listing ID : Property Identification from Listing table
      ID : Identification of specific review
      Reviewer ID: Person leaving review 

Calendar - Shows listing, date, Available (true if rented or false if not ), amount rented for 
      

** Use Case  ** 
If someone wanted to start a BNB business, What factors would they need to know? 
- How expensive is each Zip Code? 
- Bedrooms? 
- Profit margin? 
- How much can he charge?
